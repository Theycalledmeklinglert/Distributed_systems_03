I have decided to make use of private caching in this system because the proper support of authorization
is otherwise not possible. If we use public caching a classified ressource that is requested by an authorized
user will get saved by nginx and can then be requested by unauthorized users from the cache. This would completely
invalidate the authorization of the system since only lecturers and admins are allowed to get information from the system
and I have therefore decided not to use public caching.
